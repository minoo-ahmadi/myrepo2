## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Practice 1: Adding row/column to a matrix:
```{r starwars}
# Creat star_wars_matrix
box_office <- c(460.998, 314.4, 290.475, 247.900, 309.306, 165.8)
region <- c("US", "non-US")
titles <- c("A New Hope", "The Empire Strikes Back", "Return of the Jedi")
               
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE,
                           dimnames = list(titles, region))

# Creat star_wars_matrix2 as a matrix with data for the prequels trilogy
star_wars_matrix2 <- matrix(c(474.5, 552.5, 310.7, 338.7, 380.3, 468.5),
                            nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE, 
                            dimnames = list(c("The Phantom Menace", "Attack of the Clones", "Revenge of the Sith"), region))

# Combine both Star Wars trilogies in one matrix (i.e. add rows)
all_wars_matrix <- rbind(star_wars_matrix, star_wars_matrix2)

# The worldwide box office figures
worldwide_vector <- rowSums(all_wars_matrix)

# Bind the new variable worldwide_vector as a column to star_wars_matrix
all_wars_matrix <- cbind (all_wars_matrix, worldwide_vector)

# Total revenue for US and non-US
total_revenue_vector <- colSums(all_wars_matrix)

# Bind total_revenue_vector as a row to all_wars_matrix
all_wars_matrix <- rbind (all_wars_matrix, total_revenue_vector)

# Print out all_wars_matrix
all_wars_matrix
```
